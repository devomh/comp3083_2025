    "\n",
    "### Prompt for AI Assistant:\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Explain the key differences between running a Python script from the terminal versus executing code cells in a Jupyter notebook. Include aspects like execution model, state management, development workflow, output handling, and when to use each approach.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comprehensive Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Execution Model:\n",
    "- **Python Script**: Executes entire file from top to bottom in one process, then terminates\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook**: Executes individual cells interactively, maintains persistent session\n",
    "\n",
    "#### State Management:\n",
    "- **Python Script**: Variables and imports only exist during script execution\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook**: Variables persist between cell executions within the same session\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Development Workflow:\n",
    "- **Python Script**: Write complete code, save file, run entire script, debug, repeat\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook**: Write code incrementally, test small pieces, iterate quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output Handling:\n",
    "- **Python Script**: Output goes to terminal/console, requires explicit print statements\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook**: Automatically displays last expression value, rich output support\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use Each:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Python Scripts for:**\n",
    "- Production applications\n",

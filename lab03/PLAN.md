## Content Strategy

### Learning Progression
1. **Foundation Building**: Professional development environment setup
2. **Tool Mastery**: VS Code features and Python development workflow  
3. **Practical Application**: Real-world API integration project
4. **Professional Practices**: Code organization, documentation, version control

### Key Features
- **Hands-on Focus**: Every concept demonstrated with practical examples
- **Professional Workflow**: Industry-standard tools and practices
- **Progressive Complexity**: Building from basic imports to full API integration
- **Error Handling**: Debugging and troubleshooting built into curriculum
- **Real-world Connection**: Weather API project students can extend and showcase

### Pedagogical Approach
- **Connect to Previous Learning**: Explicit links to Lab 01 (AI tools/workflows) and Lab 02 (programming fundamentals)
- **Scaffolded Learning**: Each section builds on the previous
- **Interactive Elements**: Coding challenges, pair programming, live demonstrations
- **Professional Context**: Career relevance and industry practices throughout

## Technical Implementation Details

### 02_IDE.md Structure
- **Section 2.1**: VS Code interface tour with interactive exploration
- **Section 2.2**: Essential extensions with feature demonstrations
- **Section 2.3**: Virtual environments with conda/pip workflow
- **Section 2.4**: Project organization with template creation
- **Section 2.5**: Library imports and function definitions (bridge to API work)

### 03_API.md Structure  
- **Section 3.1**: API concepts with browser-based exploration
- **Section 3.2**: Complete weather app implementation
  - Step 1: API registration and testing (10 min)
  - Step 2: Core implementation with full code walkthrough (25 min)
  - Step 3: Debugging and enhancement challenges (10 min)
- **Section 3.3**: Advanced error handling and professional practices

### Example Files Purpose
- **math_functions.py**: Introduces import statements and function syntax
- **weather_checker.py**: Demonstrates complete professional application structure
- **weather_with_errors.py**: Provides debugging practice with common mistakes

## Assessment Integration
- **Functional Weather App**: Working API integration with error handling
- **Project Structure**: Professional organization and documentation
- **Requirements File**: Proper dependency management
- **GitHub Repository**: Version control and portfolio building

## Time Management
- **Total**: 180 minutes (3 hours)
- **Prerequisites & Setup**: 20 min
- **Introduction & Context**: 15 min  
- **VS Code IDE**: 70 min (increased from 60 to accommodate section 2.5)
- **Break**: 10 min
- **APIs & Integration**: 75 min
- **Assessment**: 10 min
- **Troubleshooting**: 15 min
- **Wrap-up**: 10 min
- **Buffer**: 5 min

## Success Metrics
Students will demonstrate:
1. **Professional Environment**: Configured VS Code with extensions and virtual environments
2. **Code Organization**: Properly structured Python projects with documentation
3. **API Integration**: Working weather application with live data
4. **Error Handling**: Debugging skills and robust exception management
5. **Version Control**: Git workflow and GitHub repository management

## Next Steps After Plan Completion
1. Complete remaining content files (02_IDE.md, 03_API.md)
2. Create all Python example files
3. Write comprehensive README.md
4. Test all code examples and instructions
5. Review for consistency with course progression
6. Prepare instructor materials and troubleshooting guides

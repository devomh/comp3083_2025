# What is Vibe Coding?

## History and Origins
- Term coined by AI researcher Andrej Karpathy (February 2025)
- Emerged with powerful Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Originally designed for rapid, disposable prototyping
- Intended for "throwaway weekend projects" and "software for one"

## Definition
- "Fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists"
- AI-assisted development where natural language drives code creation
- Developer role shifts from code writer to director/guide
- Communication through natural language instead of programming syntax

## Core Workflow
1. **Describe the Goal**: High-level natural language prompt
   - Example: "Create a Python function that reads a CSV file and returns email column values"
2. **AI Generates Code**: AI interprets request and produces code block
3. **Execute and Observe**: Run generated code to test functionality
4. **Provide Feedback**: Natural language refinement instructions
   - Example: "Add error handling for when file is not found"
5. **Repeat**: Iterative cycle until desired result achieved

## Two Distinct Approaches

### "Pure" Vibe Coding (HIGH RISK)
- Complete trust in AI output without understanding
- No code review or architectural responsibility
- "Forget the code exists" mentality
- Abdication of critical thinking and oversight
- Focus solely on end result, treating code as irrelevant

### Responsible AI-Assisted Development
- AI as "pair programmer" or advanced autocomplete
- Human maintains control and ownership
- Rigorous review, testing, and understanding of all output
- Full responsibility for quality control and security
- Leverages AI speed while maintaining engineering discipline

## Semantic Drift Problem
- Original experimental concept became mainstream buzzword
- Tool vendors promoted beyond intended scope
- Marketing downplayed limitations and risks
- Created confusion between responsible AI use and reckless practices
- Led to applying "throwaway" methodology to production systems

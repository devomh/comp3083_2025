# AI-Driven Development Workflow

This workflow is particularly well-suited for complex projects and team environments.

### Step 1: Formal Design and Problem Formulation (The "Blueprint")

This step is your foundation. Instead of just a simple document, you'll create a formal "Blueprint" that serves as the single source of truth for the project.

* **Action:** Create a document (or a series of documents) that includes a **Problem Statement**, **Functional Requirements**, **Non-Functional Requirements**, and a high-level **System Architecture Diagram**. Include a section for **Deliverables** and a **Test Plan**.
* **Importance:** This phase prevents "garbage in, garbage out." It forces you to think through all aspects of the problem, including edge cases and performance requirements, before any code is written. The formal structure makes it easier to communicate with other developers and stakeholders.
* **Scenarios:** This is essential for any project that will be maintained over time, is part of a larger system, or involves a team. For a quick, one-off script, a less formal version of this step might suffice, but for a mission-critical application, it's non-negotiable.

### Step 2: Agent-Assisted Scaffolding and High-Level Design (The "Collaboration")

This is where you bring the agent in as a design partner. You're not just telling it what to do, you're asking for its expert opinion.

* **Action:** Provide your formal Blueprint document to the agent. Prompt it to generate a **Proposed Project Structure**, **High-Level Implementation Plan**, and **Algorithm Alternatives**. Ask the agent to critique your plan and identify potential weaknesses or more efficient approaches.
* **Importance:** This leverages the agent's vast knowledge base to validate your initial design. It can spot common pitfalls, suggest modern libraries, or propose a more scalable architecture. This step saves you from committing to a flawed design early on.
* **Scenarios:** This is most appropriate when you're working with a new technology stack, a complex domain, or when you need to quickly explore multiple architectural options. It's a great way to accelerate the learning curve.

### Step 3: Detailed Implementation and Code Generation (The "Automated Build")

With a solid, validated design, you can now confidently automate the coding process.

* **Action:** Feed the agent the formal Blueprint, the agent-generated high-level design, and any specific coding constraints (e.g., "Use Python 3.10 and the FastAPI framework"). Instruct the agent to generate the actual code, including **Unit Tests**, **API Documentation**, and a **README file**.
* **Importance:** This phase dramatically accelerates development. By providing a clear and comprehensive context, you get high-quality code that is well-documented and testable. The agent handles the tedious work of writing boilerplate code and tests, freeing you to focus on more complex tasks.
* **Scenarios:** This is ideal for generating the initial skeleton of an application, creating a new module, or implementing a feature that follows a well-defined pattern. The generated code becomes the starting point for your project.

### Step 4: Human Review and Refinement (The "Quality Assurance")

The final step is critical for ensuring quality, security, and maintainability. The human is still in the loop as the final arbiter.

* **Action:** Review the generated code, tests, and documentation. Check for code quality, security vulnerabilities, and adherence to your project's coding standards. **Run the generated tests** and perform manual testing. Merge the changes into the codebase only after you are fully satisfied.
* **Importance:** This step prevents the agent from introducing subtle bugs or security flaws. It's a quality control gate that ensures the final product is robust and ready for production. Your expertise as a developer is essential here for reviewing logic and ensuring the solution is truly optimal.
* **Scenarios:** This step is mandatory for all projects, regardless of their size or complexity. It's a non-negotiable part of a professional software development lifecycle and a key responsibility of any developer.

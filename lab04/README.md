## Key Programming Concepts Reinforced

### Data Structures
- **Strings**: Text processing, validation, and formatting
- **Lists**: Sequential data, sorting, and comprehensions
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value mapping, nested structures, and iteration
- **JSON**: Data serialization and external data exchange

### Control Flow
- **For Loops**: Definite iteration with various patterns
- **While Loops**: Indefinite iteration based on conditions
- **Loop Control**: Strategic use of break, continue, and else

### Problem-Solving Methodology
- **Analysis**: Breaking down complex problems into manageable steps
- **Design**: Planning data structures and algorithms before coding
- **Implementation**: Writing clean, readable, and efficient code
- **Testing**: Systematic verification of solution correctness

## Best Practices Emphasized

1. **Code Organization**: Use meaningful variable names and consistent formatting
2. **Error Handling**: Anticipate and handle edge cases gracefully  
3. **Efficiency**: Choose appropriate data structures for specific tasks
4. **Readability**: Write self-documenting code with clear logic flow
5. **Testing**: Verify solutions with multiple test cases and edge conditions

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Data Structure Issues
- **Index Errors**: Always check list bounds before accessing elements
- **Key Errors**: Use `.get()` method for safe dictionary access
- **Type Errors**: Validate data types before performing operations

### Loop Problems
- **Infinite Loops**: Ensure while loop conditions eventually become False
- **Modification During Iteration**: Avoid changing lists while iterating over them
- **Off-by-One Errors**: Be careful with range boundaries and indexing

### JSON Handling
- **JSON Decode Errors**: Always use try-except blocks for JSON operations
- **File Not Found**: Check file paths and handle missing files gracefully
- **Data Validation**: Verify JSON structure matches expected format

Module 1 — Variables and Types Review (Reframed)

Goal
- Reframe variables as references to objects. Clarify identity vs equality and mutability vs immutability. Introduce light type hints.

Key Points
- Everything is an object: use `type()`, `id()`, `dir()`.
- Identity vs equality: `is` checks object identity; `==` compares values.
- Mutability: strings/ints are immutable; lists/dicts/sets are mutable.
- Type hints communicate intent and improve IDE support (not enforced at runtime).

Short Exercises (complete in 35–45 minutes)
1) Identity Detective: Predict `is` vs `==` for different assignments.
2) Mutation Station: Identify which operations create new objects vs modify in place.
3) Type Explorer: Use `type()`, `id()`, `dir()`, and `help()` on values.
4) Reference Puzzle: Explain aliasing effects on nested structures.
5) Type Annotations: Add type hints to simple functions.

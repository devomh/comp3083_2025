Module 3 — Standard Library Core Objects

Goal
- Practice with `datetime`, `pathlib.Path`, `random`, and `collections` through small, realistic tasks.

Focus Areas
- `datetime`: create/format/compute with dates and times.
- `pathlib.Path`: inspect files/dirs, join paths, check existence.
- `random`: selection, sampling, shuffling, seeding.
- `collections`: `Counter`, `defaultdict`, `deque`, `namedtuple` (light-touch).

Exercises (60–70 minutes)
1) Days Until: compute days until a target date.
2) Extension Counter: count files by extension in a directory.
3) Password Generator: configurable random password.
4) Top-N Letters: frequency analysis with `Counter`.

How to Work
- Read this file, then complete the functions in `03_Standard_Library_Objects.py`.
- Run it from the terminal: `python3 lab06/03_Standard_Library_Objects.py`.

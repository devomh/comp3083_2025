Module 2 — Objects and Methods Fundamentals

Goal
- Embrace the dot-notation model: objects receive messages via `object.method()`.
- Distinguish attributes (state) vs methods (behavior). Practice method chaining.
- Build exploration habits with `dir()` and `help()`.

Key Points
- Function vs method: `len(seq)` vs `seq.count(value)`.
- Attributes vs methods: `obj.value` (no parentheses) vs `obj.do()`.
- Method chaining works when operations return new objects (common for immutable types).
- Explore: `dir(obj)` to discover; `help(obj.method)` for docs.

Short Exercises (40–50 minutes)
1) Method Hunt: list public methods containing a substring.
2) Attribute/Method Split: separate attributes from methods on an object.
3) Chain Reaction: refactor nested function calls into fluent method chains.
4) Docs Dive: use `help()` to answer a concrete usage question.

How to Work
- Read this file, then open and complete: `02_Objects_Methods.py`.
- Run it from the terminal: `python3 lab06/02_Objects_Methods.py`.

Lab 06 — Object-Oriented Thinking with Python Standard Library

Overview
- Focus: Build intuition for objects and methods using familiar standard library types before writing your own classes.
- Scope reduced to ~3 hours. Fundamentals over advanced topics.
- Work in this folder only: `lab06/`.

Learning Objectives
- Explain that “everything is an object” with identity, type, and value.
- Distinguish equality (`==`) vs identity (`is`) and mutability effects.
- Use dot notation to call methods; differentiate attributes vs methods.
- Explore APIs with `dir()`, `help()`, and official docs.
- Apply core library objects: `datetime`, `pathlib.Path`, `random`, `collections`.
- Read/write files safely with context managers and `pathlib` convenience methods.

Schedule (~3 hours)
- Module 1 (35–45 min): Variables, identity vs equality, mutability, type hints.
- Module 2 (40–50 min): Objects and methods, attributes vs methods, method chaining, `dir()`/`help()`.
- Module 3 (60–70 min): Standard library core objects: `datetime`, `pathlib`, `random`, `collections`.
- File I/O Mini (20–30 min): Context managers and `Path` read/write utilities.
- Practice (pick 3 of 5, ~30–40 min): Small integrated problems.

What to Do
- Read each module’s `.md` for guidance, then complete the matching `.py` exercises.
- Prefer running functions from the command line or an IDE. No external packages required.
- Submit your updated `.py` files and any generated outputs as directed by your instructor.

Files in This Lab
- Module 1: `01_Variables_Types_Review.md`, `01_Variables_Types_Review.py`
- Module 2: `02_Objects_Methods.md`, `02_Objects_Methods.py`
- Module 3: `03_Standard_Library_Objects.md`, `03_Standard_Library_Objects.py`
- File I/O Mini: `05_File_Handling_Patterns.md`, `05_File_Handling_Patterns.py`
- Practice Set: `06_Practice_Problems.py`

Notes
- Advanced topics from the full script (e.g., `itertools`, capstone CLI project) are intentionally omitted here to fit the 3‑hour scope.
- All tasks rely on the Python standard library; no additional dependencies.
